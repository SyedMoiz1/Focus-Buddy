Description: 
Many people suffer with losing focus. Focus buddy looks to fix this by creating
set intervals for working and breaking. Focus buddy also reminds users to stay on task
by tracking their eyes, and also runs a game/website during their breaktime to make
sure users actually take their breaks and dont get burnt out

NOTE: Currently only runs on linux!

Antoine Lame's Gaze Tracking was a huge help as it supplied the code for the eye tracking.
Was reponsible for the entire gaze_tracking directory
